# TerrainPAICG
Harnessing basic Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques to generate image datasets as the basis to train an image-based AI model.

## Project Structure

This project blends different technologies for the sake of it, for the joy unique to creating an overengineered mess.

Thus, the project structure is as follows.
1. A C library of basic PCG techniques and utilities for image generation.
2. A Julia module that trains image-based AI models from PCG-generated datasets, by invoking the C library.
